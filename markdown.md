Text Editors are great for code completing, syntax highlighting, and extensions.
Markdown is a text editor you can use on GitHub. With it you can use italics, make bold words, and quote somebody.
When you master markdown you are on your way to creating the website you want to make the way you want it.

**Bold** also does the trick. You use <When you are backquoting somebody.

[Get Rich Quick!](https://dogecoin.com)
                                            
The way i added a hyperlink was by typing Get Rich Quick! in square brackets and then by typing the website url in parentheses.
