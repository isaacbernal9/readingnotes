This is my notes for my markdown reading:

Text Editors are great for code completing, syntax highlighting, and extensions.
Markdown is a text editor you can use on GitHub. With it you can use italics, make bold words, and quote somebody.
When you master markdown you are on your way to creating the website you want to make the way you want it.

*Italics* are good for emphasizing words. 
**Bold** also does the trick. You use <When you are backquoting somebody.

I added an image by typing an exclamation point and then the image title in square brackets followed by a link to the image in parenthesis. I still don't know how to make the image smaller, though.
