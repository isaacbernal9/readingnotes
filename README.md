### Growth Mindset
Growth Mindet means not having a fixed mindset of thinking you can't learn something new. These are my reminders to stay in the Growth Mindset.
1. Never say "I can't." Instead say "I will learn how."
2. Instead of avoiding challenges I need to embrace them because they will help me grow.
3. I shouldn't compare myself with other people because I am in a different part of my journey t han they are.
